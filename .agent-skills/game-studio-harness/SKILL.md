  Five-role game production studio harness: director, numeric-balance designer, revenue-band PM,
  verification-strict programmer, archetype-rotation QA. Runs the 3-stage operating cycle
  (concept/presentation/core build → balance/core-loop/novelty → ops stability/play impact) behind
  8 numeric quality gates with survey-grounded trends, signed designer↔PM negotiation records, and
  QA broadcast discipline. Writes the repository rule file (CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md) so the contract
  outlives the session, and keeps one live `_workspace/current/` beside a read-only archive.

# Game Studio Harness

Producer-orchestrated 5-agent team for full game production cycles, following
the bmad-gds method (intake brief → one operating mode → coordination
artifact → specialist routing → milestone thread) with numeric quality gates.
The harness is a standing structure: cycles repeat until the game ships and
keep repeating for live operation.

Read `references/quality-gates.md`, `references/stage-cycle.md`, and
`references/artifact-contract.md` before creating a run. Gate thresholds in
`references/quality-gates.md` override any paraphrase in this guide.

## When to use this skill
- Start a new game production cycle from an idea, GDD, prototype, or existing build
- Resume an in-flight cycle (read `_workspace/current/production/task-manifest.md` first)
- Run a stage-gate review (G1–G8 verdicts) on the current build
- Reprioritize when playtest feedback, defects, and milestone pressure collide

Route narrower packets to their own skills instead: raw build/log failure →
`game-build-log-triage`; profiler capture → `game-performance-profiler`;
feedback-only triage → `game-demo-feedback-triage`; store-page/launch ops →
`steam-store-launch-ops`; pre-production ideation → `bmad-idea`.

## Team

| Role | Template | Owns |
|---|---|---|
| game-production-director | `templates/agents/game-production-director.md` | Intake, task manifest, gate verdicts, arbitration, retrospective |
| game-designer | `templates/agents/game-designer.md` | Balance sheet, combo matrix, core loop, novelty scorecard, worldview, presentation spec, trend surveys |
| game-pm | `templates/agents/game-pm.md` | Revenue map, reward bands (comeback ≤30%, free/paid parity 10–20 sessions, win-rate delta ≤5%p), negotiation record, revenue forecast |
| game-programmer | `templates/agents/game-programmer.md` | Architecture contract, perf budget (p95 ≤16.7ms, input ≤100ms), movement-path optimization, tech verification, telemetry, defect responses |
| game-qa | `templates/agents/game-qa.md` | Archetype rotation (≥5 types), exploit register, benchmark survey, gate measurements, defect/regression registers |

Communication topology: director assigns and gates; QA broadcasts every
exploit/discovery to ALL agents with a feedback request; designer↔PM
negotiate reward/revenue couplings in a signed record; programmer answers
every defect within the cycle (`fixed` or `deferred` + reasoning).

## Instructions

### Step 0: Preparation
Why: every artifact must be traceable, and the workspace has exactly one live folder.
1. Create `_workspace/current/{intake,design,pm,engineering,qa,ops,ui,production,messages,retrospectives}/` at the target repo root. Do **not** create a dated run directory — `run-id` (`{YYYYMMDD}-{cycle-label}`) is a value carried inside the documents and becomes a directory name only at archive time (`_workspace/archive/{run-id}/`).
2. If resuming, read `_workspace/current/production/task-manifest.md` and the last retrospective; enter at the recorded stage instead of Stage 1.
3. At cycle close, `git mv` superseded lane material into `_workspace/archive/{run-id}/`. Never delete a `_workspace/` artifact.

### Step 0.5: Write the repository rule file
Why: the harness only governs the session that runs it. Everything the studio
learns — lane ownership, the engine boundary, which generator owns which asset
class, the git-safety protocol — evaporates the moment this session ends unless
it is written where every future session must read it.

1. Copy `templates/repo-rules.md` to the target repo's agent instruction file
   (`CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code; mirror to `AGENTS.md` for Codex/Gemini/OpenCode
   as a **pointer**, not a second copy — two contracts drift, and a drifted
   contract is worse than none).
2. Resolve every `{PLACEHOLDER}` against the real repository. A surviving
   placeholder is a defect. Delete sections that do not apply: a rule nobody
   follows teaches future sessions that rules are optional.
3. State the reason beside any rule whose violation is tempting or whose cost is
   invisible. `Never rename X` gets ignored; `renaming X orphans every existing
   player's save data` gets obeyed.
4. Re-derive it at each cycle close, not just at run creation. The rule file is
   a cycle artifact — when `current/` gains a lane, when a generator is
   replaced, or when a hard-won invariant is discovered, it is stale until
   updated.

### Step 1: Materialize the team
Why: agents must be file-based so sessions can reuse them.
- Claude Code with `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1`: copy `templates/agents/*.md` into the target repo's `.claude/agents/` (skip files that already exist and match), then use TeamCreate + SendMessage + TaskCreate/TaskUpdate.
- Any other runtime (Codex, Gemini, OpenCode) or teams flag off: run the same roles as sequential sub-agents in the phase order of `references/stage-cycle.md`; peer messages become numbered files in `_workspace/current/messages/{seq}-{from}.md`.

### Step 2: Intake (director)
Normalize the request into `intake/production-brief.md` (bmad-gds schema:
game_type, team_shape, engine, current_stage, next_public_beat,
source_packet, main_constraint, main_question). Choose ONE operating mode
for the cycle and state the next public beat explicitly.

### Step 3: Run the 3-stage operating cycle
Follow `references/stage-cycle.md` exactly. Summary:

- **Stage 1 — Concept, presentation, animation, resources, core build**:
  designer (concept + worldview + numeric skeleton + trend survey via the
  `survey` skill + core-loop candidate + presentation spec) ∥ PM
  (revenue-point draft) ∥ QA (benchmark survey + test plan + archetype set).
  Then designer↔PM negotiation round 1, then programmer builds core loop +
  presentation/animation + resource manifest + telemetry draft.
  Gate: G7 draft, G1 draft, G6-ops draft.
- **Stage 2 — Balance, core-loop stability, novelty development**:
  QA exploit hunt across archetypes → designer retune → PM reward-band
  adjustment → negotiation round 2 → programmer applies data-only changes →
  QA re-verification. Gate: G2, G3, G5, G7 final, G8.
- **Stage 3 — Ops stability and play impact (연출/시나리오/이펙트)**:
  programmer perf+memory+movement optimization and ops hardening ∥
  designer+programmer presentation/scenario/effect impact pass ∥ QA full
  regression + immersion scoring ∥ PM revenue-consistency forecast.
  Gate: G4, G6 final, G1 final.

Gate verdicts are PASS / FIX (≤2 revision loops) / REDO (previous stage).
An open S1 defect or missing evidence blocks any PASS.

### Step 4: Cycle close (director)
1. Write `retrospectives/cycle-{n}-retrospective.md`: per-gate measured values,
   unresolved risks, and the next-cycle entry decision (Stage 1 concept shift
   vs Stage 2 retune).
2. Re-derive the repository rule file (Step 0.5) if this cycle changed a lane,
   replaced a generator, or discovered an invariant worth enforcing.
3. `git mv` the superseded lane material into `_workspace/archive/{run-id}/`.
   `current/` keeps only what the next cycle carries forward; nothing leaves
   `_workspace/`.

The cycle loops — the studio is a standing structure, not a one-shot pipeline.

### Step 5: Error handling
| Scenario | Response |
|---|---|
| Agent timeout | Retry once → mark task `failed`, continue partial, flag in gate review |
| Data conflict | Log `conflicts.md`; prefer newer measurement; director arbitrates numerically |
| Missing output | Gate cannot PASS; warn in review |
| Messaging failure | File-based fallback via `messages/` |

## Examples

### Example 1: New cycle from an idea
Input: "다크판타지 RTS 아이디어로 게임 제작 사이클 시작해줘"
Expected: run-id created, production brief written, team materialized,
Stage 1 tasks assigned; designer trend survey and QA benchmark survey run
via the `survey` skill; cycle ends with retrospective + G1–G8 gate table.

### Example 2: Stage-gate review on existing build
Input: "현재 빌드로 스테이지 게이트 리뷰 돌려줘"
Expected: QA measures G1–G8 on the build, director issues per-gate
PASS/FIX/REDO verdicts with evidence paths, FIX items become manifest tasks.

### Example 3: Balance emergency
Input: "QA가 무한조합 익스플로잇 찾음, 사이클 재진입"
Expected: enter at Stage 2 Phase 2a with the exploit register pre-seeded;
designer retune, PM reward-coupling check, programmer data-only change,
QA re-verifies the band before the gate closes.

## Best practices
1. One operating mode per cycle — mixing concept work and launch ops in one pass weakens both.
2. Numbers gate everything: no adjective ever passes a gate (`references/quality-gates.md`).
3. Surveys before invention: designer trend survey and QA benchmark survey are Stage 1 prerequisites, not optional garnish.
4. Preserve `_workspace/` artifacts — they are the studio's memory across cycles. Archive, never delete.
5. The rule file is the studio's only durable output. A harness run that ships a build but leaves no contract has taught the next session nothing.
6. Keep the milestone thread: every task names the next public beat it serves.
7. QA broadcast discipline: every exploit/discovery goes to all agents with an explicit feedback request — QA sense is the studio's shared sense.
