"""Build the A0-c' frontmatter exception ledger (5 records).

The ledger is a RESULT byte pin, not a permission slip: it records both
`before_sha256` (must equal the A0-c baseline) and `after_sha256` (the exact
bytes L1x must produce). A listed skill that lands on any other hash fails rule
F just as loudly as an unlisted skill that changed.

This script only COMPUTES and VERIFIES the pins — it never writes SKILL.md.
G001 does not touch product content; L1x (G002) applies the edits.

Each candidate is checked for: YAML validity, description <= 1024 chars, and the
D-1 trigger-keyword subset rule (anything lost must be in `approved_removals`).
